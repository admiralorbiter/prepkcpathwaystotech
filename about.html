                <h2>About Pathways to Technology</h2>
                <p>PREP-KC’s Pathways to Technology program is designed to give Kansas City’s urban high school students a jumpstart on a postsecondary degree and a career in technology-related fields. The students’ experiences in the Pathway to Technology program provides an immersive classroom experience, and better prepares them for college and careers by integrating career-readiness experiences and college course work into the high school program of study. Data from PREP-KC’s Academies indicate an average postsecondary enrollment rate of 74% for Academy graduates.  This exceeds the national averages for low-income (52%) and middle-income (65%) students.</p>
                <p>This is a year-long class starting at Cerner in the fall paired with an internship in the spring. During the internships, students are placed on teams alongside professionals working on real-world projects. The class in the fall is dual credit eligible, participating students will be provided transportation to Cerner for class and internship experiences. Participating students will receive a full scholarship for the dual credit course.</p>

                <p>I am a programmer, turned educator focused on bringing transferable and technical skills to the youth of Kansas City in order to prepare them for the modern workforce. As a developer I have always been interested in a wide range of technologies, this broad interest has helped me as I have pivoted into education. I am able to meet students where they currently are and bridge the technical gaps in order to prepare them for a large variety of client projects and internship opportunities. </p>
                <p>Beyond working with the students as their instructor and mentor, I also manage our strategic partnerships with PREP-KC’s tech partners including businesses such as Cerner. I manage the day-to-day recruitment and logistics and work on long-term planning to build a pipeline of computer science classes in our district’s high schools. </p>
